# Laplace-over-relax

This project invoves using the method of successive overrelaxation and determining its effectiveness in order to solve laplace/poissons equation in 2 dimensions. Successive relaxation is one of numerous methods that can be used in order to solve these equations, other options still being explored are monte-carlo method.
